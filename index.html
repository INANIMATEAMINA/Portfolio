      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Thanks for your interest, here is a quick story of me.
        My mother first called me Amina when I was three years old. Until then, I responded to my nickname 'Gul.' My
        personality contains two shades incomplete without each other. Amina represents an amenable and intelligent girl
        who has the spark to make small footprints of revolution in the carnivorous society. At the same time, 'Gul' is
        omnivorous as she is carbonated with a warm heart and loving nature. A girl saved a dog at death's door from the
        frost of winter by making a shelter from cardboard, working the whole day on freezing winter days so that the
        dog may live longer.
        I'm sure I'll add an extra flavour to the class of different flavours. And as I'm a bubbly person, I can be the
        link that joins the class together.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My parents always wanted to watch me grow as a person. They genuinely believe GWC is best for this. I am not
        able because I love to learn things, and I am looking for a place that can inspire me what's better than the
        GWC, Moreover It will help me get one step closer to the luminescent MIT. To conclude, I am a shining flower who
        soaks sunlight to spray her fragrance all around. Thanks again for reading this, because of people like you, it
        exists and prospers!
        Cheers,
        InanimateAmina

          <p>Coding has been on my nerves ever since my father gifted me [Amie]. MY LAPTOP,#<include> is flowing through
              me, Yale being the most prestigious and advanced in IT, has magnetised me, .with the ongoing research on
              digital health care in digital healthcare in IT projects has made it the best choice for me to pursue my
              interest. Being a great observer and always keen on innovation and research in YYGS offers the best
              platform to resonate with my passion.</p>

          <p>My interest in studying was sparked when I received good grades in math and science. The feeling of seeing
            my family happy fueled my desire to grow, and I don't think it will ever stop.</p>

          <h4>Basketball team captian</h4>
          <p>As a basketball team captain, I believed in the spirit of cooperation. I once urged my school
            administration to organise a match with deaf children to show them they are not inferior to anyone.
